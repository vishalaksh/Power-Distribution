Power-Distribution
==================

1. In manual, we see the peak value of VA in the power curve array rather than the total energy that is the summation of elements of the array.

2. when overload occurs in a phase, then program automatically tries the next phase

3.  App takes input from a file "Input_Data.txt". This file is created after the attached file is executed for the first time within the same folder.

4.  If you want to tweak something, you might want to look into Constants.java
